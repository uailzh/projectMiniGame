Mastermind Game

This simple Python script implements the classic Mastermind game. The game generates a random secret code consisting of colors, and the player has a limited number of attempts to guess the correct code. After each guess, the player receives feedback on the correctness of the colors and their positions. The game continues until the player correctly guesses the code or runs out of attempts.

How to Play:

The valid colors are represented by the letters: R, G, B, Y, W, O.
You have a specified number of attempts (default: 10) to guess the secret code.
Enter your guesses as space-separated colors (e.g., "R G B Y").
After each guess, you'll receive feedback on the correct and incorrect positions of the guessed colors.
Win by correctly guessing the entire code within the given number of attempts.
Have fun playing Mastermind!
